<h2>AirBnB clone general description</h2>
<p>The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.</p><br>
<h3>About Airbnb</h3>
<p>Airbnb was born in 2007, when two of its founders welcomed three guests to their San Francisco apartment. It has grown a lot since then and currently has 4 million hosts who have shared their accommodations with more than 1 billion travelers in almost every country in the world. Every day, hosts offer exceptional stays and unique experiences that allow travelers to discover the world in a more authentic and intimate way.</p>
<br>
<h3>-Learning Objectives</h3>
<p>At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:</p>
<p>
    -How to create a Python package<br>
    -How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module<br>
    -What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project<br>
    -How to serialize and deserialize a Class<br>
    -How to write and read a JSON file<br>
    -How to manage datetime<br>
    -What is an UUID<br>
    -What is *args and how to use it<br>
    -What is **kwargs and how to use it<br>
    -How to handle named arguments in a function<br>
</p>
<h3>The console</h3>
<p>
-create your data model<br>
-manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter<br>
-store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.
<br><br>
This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.
<br><br>
The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine
